# Helmet-and-no-plate-detection

Prepare to explore Python, YOLOv3, and computer vision in this beginner-friendly guide.

✅Why It Matters:
Helmets are crucial for rider safety, yet some riders neglect them. This system employs AI to identify helmet-less riders, spot their number plates, and potentially issue e-challans (with legal protocols in place). It's a powerful application of technology for safety enforcement.

✅let's break it down step-by-step:

Setting Up:
Virtual Environment Setup: Install software to create a virtual environment (like Anaconda).
Library Installation: Inside the virtual environment, install YOLOv3 and OpenCV libraries using package managers like pip.

Code Time:
Import Libraries: Start by importing necessary libraries like OpenCV.
Load YOLO Model: Load the pre-trained YOLOv3 model for object detection.
Read Image: Read the image where you want to detect helmets and plates.
Object Detection: Use YOLOv3 to detect objects (helmets and plates) in the image.
Display Results: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects on the image.

✅Create a conda environment and install the required libraries
conda create -n hnpdr python=3.9 && conda activate hnpdr && pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow imutils

✅Code is given in the detect.py file 

✅let's simplify and explain the code breakdown:

1. Gather Your Tools:
Import the libraries needed for the project. These libraries are like ingredients for cooking; each one serves a specific purpose in our code.

2. Prepare the Brains:
If you have a powerful GPU, let TensorFlow use it for faster processing. Load the pre-trained YOLOv3 model, which is like a super-smart brain that already knows how to detect bikes and number plates. Additionally, load a separate model specifically trained to detect helmets.

3. Set Up the Camera:
Create a virtual camera that can capture video frames. Think of it as giving your computer eyes to see.

4. Get Ready to Record:
Set up a system to save the processed video frames, creating a new video file that shows the detections happening in real-time. It's like creating a movie of what your computer sees.

5. Helmet Check!:
Define a function that examines an image and uses the helmet detection model to determine if a helmet is present. It's like asking your computer, "Is that person wearing a helmet?"

6. The Detection Loop:
Get detailed information about detected objects from the YOLOv3 model. Grab a frame from the video, prepare it for processing, and feed it into the model to identify objects. Filter out overlapping detections and highlight the most confident ones. Finally, draw boxes around bikes, number plates, and helmets, and save the processed frame into the output video file. Allow the user to stop the process at any time.

By understanding each part of the code, you'll be able to see how all the pieces come together to create a system that detects helmets and number plates in real-time video footage.
